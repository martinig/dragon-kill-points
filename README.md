# üêâ Dragon Kill Points: applying a transparent working template to relieve authorship stress
_"To whom doth the honour of the Dragonslayer belongeth?"_

This repository contains all the pre-made Dragon Kill Points [templates](https://github.com/martinig/dragon-kill-points/tree/54b801ccc4ca28d080cbc9f13e7f660b855998c7/downloadable%20templates).\
We propose Dragon Kill Points, adapted from multiplayer gaming, which tracks individual contributions to projects throughout their lifecycle. 

## ‚öîÔ∏è Method overview
 _"Slayeth the Dragon we must!"_

Dragon Kill Points is built around five key principles: granularity, responsibility, equity, autonomy, and transparency (**GREAT**). 
1. **Granularity** ensures detailed documentation of tasks, preventing underrepresentation of individual contributions.
2. **Responsibility** is maintained by setting clear authorship criteria from the outset, allowing contributors to know how their work will be recognised.
3. **Equity** ensures authorship rules apply to every team member, flattening hierarchies and highlighting ghost or gift authorship.
4. **Autonomy** allows contributors to challenge or change their authorship position based on their contributions as the project progresses.
5. **Transparency** fosters trust by continuously sharing contribution records with the entire team.
  
Through Dragon Kill Points, researchers can reduce conflicts, create more inclusive authorship practices, and acknowledge the true value of middle authorship positions. 

**This system offers a flexible and scalable approach to managing authorship across various contexts, providing a solution to the complex challenges of collaboration.**
